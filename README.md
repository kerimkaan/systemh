# systemh

> A MATLAB Calculator for the friction losses in pipe systems with any fluid

## Features

* Calculating total head (m) and power for pump in SI Units
* Plotting graph that every head and power
* Calculating resistance coefficient (K-value) of four - and can be increased -  different system component
* Calculating the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (f) with Colebrook-White algorithm

## TO-DO

* Developing every single step with functions
* Using different friction factor algorithms and showing the differences
* Increasing number of the fittings and components
* Checking the calculations' accuracy
* Improving graphs of the calculations
* Exporting the results from MATLAB to Excel file.
